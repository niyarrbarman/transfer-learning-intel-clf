# Transfer Learning using timm and PyTorch

This repository contains a transfer learning project using the [timm](https://timm.fast.ai/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries. The [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) dataset was used and the model employed was ResNet18. The goal of the project was to fine-tune the pre-trained ResNet18 model for image classification on the Intel dataset.
